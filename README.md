Ubuntu-Update
===

ubuntu-update is a bash script you can execute as soon as you format you computer with Ubuntu OS. Its main goal is to update your distro with all the latest tools for programmers in one easy install. This avoids having to install your apps one by one and running the risk of forgetting a package.

To install, run the following snippet on the command line:

    chmod u+rx ubuntu-update.bash
    ./ubuntu-update.bash
